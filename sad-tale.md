House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He dies, most of his kids die, his wife dies (although not really). 3/5 dogs die. Cersei is naked. THE RAVEN DIES! Rickon is the worst. L+R=J.

Stannis Baratheon is the One True King and was robbed of his rightful throne.
